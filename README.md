# Python-Email-API

This is just a simple API I created for a personal project a while back and I figured I should share it incase someone out there gets stuck. You would need to download all the Flask modules first to use it. The API only lists unread emails when just requesting the inbox though and cant send emails. I will update this later on because i am definitely going to use it again but it's definitely not hard to do it yourself.
